## Game planning
+ Create two arrays for two players (PlayerA & PlayerB) with game moves - 'Rock, Paper and Scissors'
+ Randomly select one of these three moves from the each array and assign the move to each player!
+ Compare the moves of each player to see who wins based on the game rules.
+ If the two moves are equal, the game is tied and are players can play again!
+ If the moves are not equal, follow the game rules to declare the winner!
+ The game rules are 'Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper and Paper beats Rock'.
+ The results will be displayed with information about each player move and winner 
## Outside resources
+ php.net documentation to define variables, if conditions, loops and random selection.
